Supported File Formats
======================

.. tip::
   Every supported format has a unique *format identifier* string, eg. ``"srt"``.
   These can be used in the API to force input/output in a certain format, though this
   is usually unnecessary thanks to autodetection from content and file extension.

Native Format -- SubStation Alpha
---------------------------------

pysubs2 is built around *SubStation Alpha*, the native subtitle format of `Aegisub <http://www.aegisub.org/>`_.
This format is popular in anime fansub community as it allows for rich text formatting and even animations
and vector graphics.

**SubStation Alpha** --- supported in two versions:

- .ass files (Advanced SubStation Alpha v4.0+), format identifier is ``"ass"``.
- .ssa files (SubStation Alpha v4.0), format identifier is ``"ssa"``.

Time-based Formats
------------------

**SubRip** --- .srt files, format identifier is ``"srt"``. Widely used subtitle format, it uses HTML
tags for formatting, though it is usually not heavily formatted (as opposed to *SubStation*).

**MPL2** --- Time-based format similar to MicroDVD, format identifier is ``"mpl2"``. To save subtitles in MPL2 format,
use ``subs.save("subtitles.txt", format_="mpl2")``.

**TMP** --- Time-based format, format identifier is ``"tmp"``. A very simple format which only specifies starting time
for each subtitle, eg. ``0:00:13:This is a subtitle``. Subtitle length is calculated automatically based on character
count. This older subtitle format is also referred to as "TMP Player" format.

**WebVTT** --- Time-based format similar to SubRip, format identifier is ``"vtt"``. Currently implemented
as a flavour of SubRip, with no extra support for WebVTT-specific features like styles or subtitle alignment.
`Link to WebVTT specification <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API>`_, official name is
"Web Video Text Tracks Format".

Frame-based Formats
-------------------

**MicroDVD** --- .sub files, format identifier is ``"microdvd"``. This format uses frames to describe start/end times,
instead of hour/minute/second, which means it is dependent on framerate of the video. For proper retiming and conversion,
you need to know the framerate (sometimes it is given in the first subtitle, which ``pysubs2`` will autodetect and use).

Other
-----

**JSON**-serialized internal representation, which amounts to ASS. Format identifier is ``"json"``.
